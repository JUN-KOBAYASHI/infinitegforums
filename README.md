## Build extension in order to upload to the Chrome Web Store
To create a zip file with the contents of the extension, which can be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store, run `bash release.bash`. You can also use `bash release.bash -channel=beta` to include a beta label in the extension name and version of the resulting zip file.

The zip file will be located in the `out` folder.
